This repo is generally maintained for my personal use.

Much of my code is merged upstream to source after being tested here.

Should you wish to toss a few bucks my way the sponsor button will take you to my paypal.me page.

Forking a repo to maintain the complete history of commit credits to all contributors is the proper way to make a public copy of a repo not for your own personal use.

For situations where forking is not a option siting the source to give credit where credit is due may also be acceptable.
