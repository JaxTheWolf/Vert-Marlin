There is no difference between upstream marlin other then my configuration files (configuration.h, configuration_adv.h) 

They where all chopped up in to seperate example files and merged in to source back in 2019.

This repo is generally maintained for my personal use, as a legacy of times past. 

Unless you intend to learn how my configurations work and operate im going to suggest you use upstream marlin 2 instead as none of the guides for marlin 2 will really apply.

Ive coded so many macros and things to switch things on and off all over that if you try to do what a guide says its prolly just gonna break eeverything.
